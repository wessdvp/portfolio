                <h2>1. Programming</h2>
                <p><strong>Python:</strong> I have been learning Python since high school, giving me about four years of experience (2018-2022) before I shifted my focus to medical school. Recently, I returned to Python to further enhance my skills. I developed my first application, AuthTerm, a terminal-based two-factor authentication (2FA) app, which deepened my understanding of application development. Currently, I am also exploring Python's applications in machine learning and data science, as I believe these areas hold significant potential for innovation in the medical field. This blend of programming and healthcare knowledge fuels my ambition to create impactful solutions through technology.</p>
